# sqlalchemy-challenge

This repo consists of:
- climate_starter_Geeson: the jupyter notebook with the analysis for the first section of the challenge
- Flask Task: the jupyter notebook of the second part, developing the API for the challenge.
- It also contains the two csv files and the hawaii.sqlite used as resources.
- And finally, the readme file.


I made reference to the following sources in addition to the materials available from the course:
